In his place is a black cloak, its arms to your shoulders, a slate of granite for a head, its edges chipped and cracking. It appears there is something behind this mask, behind this futile effort to keep your mind safe from its true visage. A voice speaks, a guttural, booming voice that is yet narrowed into a brutish whisper only for you to hear.%SPEECH_ON%I\'ll give you Death, mortal, and warmed in its comforts, Death shall be visited upon your enemies. %sacrifice% will not be lost, he will be with you always, this I promise you.%SPEECH_OFF%A whiteness snaps back over you, a rush of wind, tent flaps curling outward, candleflames tilting impossibly without going out, and a frigid coolness that has your first breath seen floating across the air. %cultist% is nowhere to be seen.

I know you\'re awake, you lark.%SPEECH_OFF%You reach over to the blanket and draw it back. You jump to your feet and nearly knock the whole tent over.
