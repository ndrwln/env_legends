Every shelf is adorned with piles of scrolls, many dwelling within glass enclosures. The shelves are stacked upon each other and seem to ascend to the very ceiling from which you descended. Rolling ladders rest at each level, but even further up runs a floating mezzanine with metal chutes stationed here and there. It seems as though once upon a time one was meant to pass these scrolls up and down, though now everything is rusted, and the mezzanine has collapsed in parts.\n\n %randombrother% calls your attention. He points to an enormous scroll flattened behind a sheet of glass. Drawings sprawl over the paper, and upon closer inspection it appears they are blueprints for seemingly everything: the human body, the bodies of many animals, castles, towers, windmills, ships, weapons and armor, boots and gloves, alignments of the stars, and a great number of drawings of things which you have never seen before, things which don\'t make sense.%SPEECH_ON%Captain, this place is not meant for us.

Suddenly, a number of the glass cases begin to glow, the phylacteries holding some sort of ethereal energy, and as the light widens it unveils the torso of a black skeleton, its body captured in air. The ribcage holds a book, hooked into place by the sickly folds of its own ribs as a spider would clutch a meal. The skull of the creature stares at you with peerless sockets.%SPEECH_ON%Your kind has already stolen from me, now you dare profane these halls again?%SPEECH_OFF%The phylacteries grow brighter and in turn the skeleton\'s torso grows flesh, weeds of vein and the pulp of skin blossoming outward to cover bone.

You stare at the phylacteries and they are brimming with energy now, and in staring you can see the ghostly faces smearing along the glass like streaks of rain. You hear a loud clap and turn back to see the Loremaster in full, its eyes aflame with white fire, its limbs skinny yet with smoky muscles winding around its frame, and its lower half is pluming with black ash as it glides forward.
