He runs the men through the usual sparring routines and checks their equipment for splits and wear, but to such light work he adds strict rules about setting up and breaking camp, formation drills, lessons on flanking, forced marches with stones in their packs, and a detailed punishment regime for anyone who dares fall behind.\n\nWords such as \'back-breaking\', \'cruel\', \'flint-hearted\' and \'merciless\', as well as dozens of saltier epithets, ring in the air whenever %sergeantbrother% is safely out of earshot, though never when he is sleeping.
