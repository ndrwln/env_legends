He can train wardogs for the highborn armies. So it is that this world snatches the talented as fast as the hawk pounces the rabbit which reveals itself.\n\n But now you\'ve your own catch: %star%. He is a genuine talent, showing remarkable aptitude in physicality, martial skills, and courage. Even the rest of the %companyname% can sense the man\'s presence as sure as one sense destiny and greatness. %star% is everything you\'d want in a mercenary, and were the company fitted entirely with a man of his mold, well, you\'d do more than chase contracts, you\'d conquer the whole world!";
