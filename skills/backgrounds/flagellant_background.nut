While flagellating himself nightly, he seeks redemption. | Hearing but a mere rumor of a holy place, the pilgrim took up staff and supplies to seek it out. | Now that war has returned to the land, the gods devotee wished to find out why, through prayer and corporeal means. | A night spent in a cave revealed to the believer that the gods demanded blood. %name% was not one to refuse their beckoning. | After raiders looted the coffers of their church, %name%\'s quest was to refill the pure purses.} {As the laws of the universe bend to a world-consuming war, a thaumaturge like %name% might be useful to have around. | They carry a whip with glass-barbed leather.
