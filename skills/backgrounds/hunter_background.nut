They missed. With a belly full of bacon, they became determined to never miss again - unless it meant more bacon, of course. | Early in his life, %name% liked to traipse about the forests. When a rabid fox attacked them, they learned to take a bow. When a devilish eagle clawed his face, they learned to shoot it.} {Once employed by local royalty, a disastrous boar hunt ended with a gored baron and all the blame - and blood - on %name%\'s hands. | The hunter hid the thought well, but for the longest time they wondered what it would be like to hunt the ultimate game: man. | Sadly, a bad game of peasant-roulette forced the deer hunter into seeking other means of income. | Unfortunately, they are not nearly as good at cooking deer as  is at shooting them. A dinner consisting of undercooked meats poisoned his entire family. His desperation for a new life is understandable. | After an arduous trip to town to sell meats and leathers, they followed the call of mercenary work. | War drove the game out of the forests, and the hunt out of %name%. Now they seek another line of work. | When his wife fell ill, they could not heal her with hunted meat. Needing to earn crowns to pay for treatment, they took up the vocation of sellswords - or sellbows, as it were.} {Any outfit could use a deadeye such as this man. | Not entirely without faults, %name% is a professional bowman nonetheless. | A quick demonstration is offered: %name% shoots one arrow high into the sky, and with another they knock it out. Impressive. | %name% looks like they have something to prove - just make sure they do it at range. When first given a sword, they grabbed it at the wrong end. Yes, that end. | The hunter wields his bow like another limb, and shoots his arrows like a preacher does words.}";
