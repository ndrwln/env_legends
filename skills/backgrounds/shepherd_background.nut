The boy took up the shepherd\'s staff and continued his work for many years. | More colorblind than a dog, %name% always enjoyed the company of color-friendly sheep. | When %name% fell from a tower, a flock of sheep broke his fall. He vowed to repay their sacrifice by being the safest shepherd in the land. | %name% found profit in bandying sheep about from one town to the next, selling their coats to tailors and skins to tanners. | Tending sheep was the easiest job %name% could find. | As harmless as the sheep he tends, %name% took to shepherding to find peace in the cruel world. | Never one to find good company amongst humans, %name% preferred the somber sapience of sheep. | Bullied as a child, %name% found peace in tending flocks of sheep. | The playfully obedient sheep of %name%\'s life gave him the peace and calm from an otherwise rough upbringing. | Once mistaken for a {prophet | new messiah}, %name% escaped the {religious hordes | angry inquisitors} by disappearing into the vocation sheep shepherding. | Watching {sheep | white blobs of wool} munch on grass all day sounds boring, but to %name% it was bliss. | Enthralled by a sheep herding competition, %name% took to shepherding as a surprisingly competitive vocation. | Always a soft, kind boy, shepherding just made sense to the likes of %name%. | Escaping his abusive {mother | father | sisters | brothers | uncle | aunt}, %name% took the tranquility of being a shepherd.} {Mixed up in a religious conflict between gods followers and cultists, his flock suffered the wrath of those looking for both scapegoats and sacrifices. | Once fending off {brigands | wolves} with his walking stick, the shepherd wondered if maybe he was more physically capable than he once thought. | As time passed, the man felt {as though his vocation had passed him by. | like his heart just wasn\'t in it anymore.} {He mournfully retired | He hung up his shepherding stick} and sought out other work. | Feeling as though he was seeing the world\'s beauty but not experiencing it in full, the man decided to abandon shepherding. | When hulking, furry beasts slaughtered his flock, the shepherd was left looking for vengeance. | Sadly, the man\'s sole companion, a shepherding dog, was killed by {brigands | orcs | wolves}, leaving the peaceful man looking for revenge. | Caught in a loan shark\'s schemes, though, the shepherd suddenly needed more coin than his flock of sheep could ever provide. | However, the loneliness of his life finally got the shepherd. | But long days and nights by himself wore on the shepherd as they would any man. | But he could not escape the masculinity his father expected of him, and one day put down his walking stick to seek out a manlier vocation. | But one day, textiling while tending, he led every last sheep over a cliff. | But on a rainy afternoon he took one baaa too many: he had to do something beyond just stare at sheep all day. | One morning he awoke covered in sheep\'s blood, entrails, and bloody, entrails-laden wool. Wolves howled merrily in the distance. As it turned out, he had counted one too many sheep that night. | Unfortunately, rumors of what he did in the privacy of his flock were too embarrassing to face and he had to flee to greener, more accepting pastures. | Sadly, brigands drunk on violence stumbled upon his flock. Bessie, Little Ada, and even the newborn Goatsieg were bloodily dispatched.} {While stopping into town to think things over, %name% stumbled upon a call for mercenaries. With nothing to lose, he is ready to sign up. | The land had no place for a peaceful shepherd. It was time to move on to a new life. | A tiny, blood-rusted bell clings below %name%\' neck. It is a relic of another life, and perhaps the sign of a new one. | He swears to still hear the bleating of his flock. For some reason, this does not inspire much confidence in his fighting skills. | Although peaceful as could be, without a flock the man is lost. | While hardly a fighter, the man knows how to keep a tight formation. | %name% knows the stars surprisingly well and can locate a sound in the darkness like a blind dog sniffing a treat. | Walking so much has given %name% sturdy legs, but the most combat experience he has is with a stick. | The world doesn\'t usually turn to shepherds in its time of need, but this is one very needy world at the moment. | Staring at the shepherd, you wonder just how bad things have gotten for such a man to be standing where he is. | %name% carries almost all weapons like they\'re walking sticks, and he has a bad habit of whacking the legs of others to move them along. | %name%\'s humility is a welcome respite from the usual gungho brethren that become sellswords. | %name% looks like he wouldn\'t hurt a fly, but with good training you can see to it that he\'ll hurt a lot more than that. | %name% doesn\'t carry the murderous conviction of other sellswords, but like any man he can be trained up in all the right ways. | Some of the %companyname%\'s men are little better than sheep. Maybe %name% has a place here after all.}";
