Wanting to be ready if he came across those responsible, he taught himself to be good enough with a blade to kill anyone. | Raised by a one-armed father, he first learned how to fight with limitations. By the time he started using both hands he could already kill anybody with just one.} {Unfortunately, time and age have withered %name% into a shell of his former self. | During the orc invasions, %name% managed to kill a dozen greenskins singlehandedly. Sadly, an impossible feat does not come without a price: his sword-hand lost three fingers and his lead foot\'s achilles was severed. | Sadly, a horde of drunks fell upon his home, each hoping to become infamous by killing the famous swordsman. He slew them all, but not before taking irreversible injuries. | Legend has it that he quarreled with a foul beast of monstrous proportions. He waves the notion away with a fingerless hand and a scarred wink. | While teaching royalty how to fight, a coup that swept the entire realm had him running for his life. | Hired to teach noble heirs fighting skills, it wasn\'t long until he was embroiled in a web of intrigue and backstabbing, and had to leave as long as he still could.} {Now the old swordsman just looks to spend the rest of his fighting knowledge on the field. | While he\'s lost his edge, the man is still plenty dangerous and some say he\'s looking to find a student before he dies. | A master in the martial arts he may be, every movement he makes is echoed by the cracking of old bones. | Depressed and without purpose, %name% now finds meaning in simply blending in with the very men he used to teach. | The man makes it impossible to get through his defense, countering everything offered, but he no longer has the jump in his step to attack back. Admirable, but sad. | Given a sword, the old guard spins and twirls it in an impressive demonstration. When he plants it in the ground, he leans on the pommel to catch his breath. Not so impressive. | The man has been robbed of his athleticism, but his knowledge has turned swordfighting into mathematics.}";
