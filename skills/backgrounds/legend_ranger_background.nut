Needing to earn crowns to pay for treatment, %name% took up the vocation of sellswords - or sellbows, as it were.} {Any outfit could use a deadeye such as this ranger. | Not entirely without faults, %name% is a professional archer nonetheless. | A quick demonstration is offered: %name% shoots one arrow high into the sky, and with another knocks it out. Impressive. | %name% has the look of someone with something to prove - just make sure it is proved at range. When first given a sword, %name% grabbed it at the wrong end.
