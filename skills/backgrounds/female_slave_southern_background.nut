Those who gave her to you stated she has a criminal past in piracy. | %name% was accused of ravishing an old woman and was given the option of execution or lifelong servitude. | Caught stealing from a fruit stall, %name% was pressed into lifelong servitude. | Fornications with \'men\' led to %name%\'s submission to servitude per the rules of the city-state in which she broke the laws. It was either that or become a sterile, and you can hardly blame her for choosing the hard labor in this case.} {The hardships of her life, rather quaintly, may serve as an excellent cast from which to mold a proper mercenary. | Her servitude no doubt made the woman formidable in appearance, though it may be hard to say where her mind is at being what is essence an indentured sellsword. | Slaves for warriors are a usual sight in the southern cities and %name% might serve as a useful, albeit enslaved, sellsword yet. | You hope %name% could make a sound sellsword, but you have the feeling her primary allegiance is to that which any woman wishes to taste: freedom.}";
