Although their current injuries suggest that at one time they still had a lot to learn. | %name% has fought alongside farmers, mercenaries and even nobles. However their inability to gain fame led them to age past their prime - and pick up an injury along the way. | The injury %name% carries is quite evident, however they assure you that they can fight just as well as any mercenary could. Only time will tell how much of a lie this might be. | %name%\'s injury was unrelated to their duties protecting their home. Instead they recite the tale of \'The cat, the witchling and the cupboard\'. Which you find works well as a way to fall asleep on your feet.} {With the writing on the wall that %name% may have a long and painful death ahead of them, they decided to do what they always dreamed of - fighting in a real battle. | Years have not been kind to %name%, however their longer than usual time spent training has gifted them with a much broader skillset than your average militia. | %name% has outlived enemies and allies alike, and now finds themselves completely alone in a world full of strangers. | %name%\'s experience and determination in the face of danger is a skill that is rare, even among more hardened professions.}";
