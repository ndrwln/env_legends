Others stop in between, disappearing into the tranquil forests.} {%name% once found a safe register amongst the trees, but that time is over. | Once a mysterious figure to hunters - the famed masskewatsthat - %name% now returns to civilization for reasons unknown. | %name%\'s got the hands of a blacksmith, but the hygiene of a pigsty. | Maybe it was spurned love, or maybe just war, but %name% has spent the last decade far from the rest of humanity. | Possibly a poacher who settled where she hunted, %name%\'s lived amongst the trees for untold years. | With cleverly stitched garb, %name%\'s atavistic appearance perhaps belies a past as a tailor or tanner.} {There is an obvious language barrier with the wildwoman, but for some reason she seems very willing to fight. Let\'s hope her newfound \'calling\' doesn\'t have a darker purpose behind it. | Colorful and permanent ritual rites circle about her body. When asked why she wishes to join a band of mercenaries, she hoots and, with a crooked finger, replicates one of her fleshen arts across the sky. | Wounds, old and fresh, dot his already mottled body. And they are not superficial - this woman had been fighting something fierce in the wild. | One has to wonder if the calamities which chased her into the forests have come to chase her back out. | Judging by her wild grunting, it\'s doubtful she\'s here to rejoin civilization. | Years as a recluse haven\'t made the woman forget what a few crowns can get you. The question is, why did she come back? | She has the strength to wrestle a boar - and her many scars makes you wonder if perhaps she did.}";
