		return "{Raised by thieves on a diet of honeymilk and stolen gold, %name% started life off on the wrong foot. | Raised by a drunken father and an ill mother, %name% was parented straight into a life of thievery. | Born as the sixth-child of an already impoverished family, the budding thief %name% first learned the craft by stealing the last bits of dinner. | Growing up in a family servant to a rich merchant, the eventual-thief %name% spent many years staring at decadent opulence - and stealing from it. | Taken in by a local orphanage, it wasn\'t long for %name% to start taking abuse from the lowly orphans. She fell back on thieving to survive. | Orphaned, %name% grew up as a street urchin, his days governed by cutting purses and picking pockets. | While never particularly in need of money, %name%\'s jealousy over material things led her to thieving. | The profligacy of the rich amidst crowds of poor always rubbed %name% the wrong way. So she stole from them both and gave to herself. | %name%\'s father taught her all there was to know about stealing including, unfortunately, how to backstab. | The church steals with a silver plate. The lords do it with the taxman. So %name% figured why can\'t she do it with her own two hands? | Impoverished while growing up, %name% took to stealing bread. Well-fed, she soon took to stealing crowns.} {After years of successful stealing, one mistake landed %name% in a dungeon. Thankfully, years of stealing also meant years of lockpicking and she didn\'t spend long. | But when she was caught trying to steal a temple\'s chalice, a talk with a monk convinced %name% to perhaps take a different path. | Unfortunately, a smash-and-grab at a local store ended with %name% being caught red-handed. She was soon profiled on posters everywhere, making her work difficult. | Daring to cut the purse of a fat trader, %name% soon found herself nursing a hand absent of a few fingers. She really liked those fingers, too. | %name%\'s thievery eventually placed her at the head of an entire guild. But after a dozen failed assassination attempts, the thief realized there was nobody to trust in her line of work. | Partnering up with a beautiful woman, %name% managed to steal from everybody. Too bad the woman stole from her, in the end. | Trying to sell some goods, a trusted fence turned out to be a traitorous informant. One bad pillory experience later and the thief was exiled from %randomtown%. | It was the perfect heist. That\'s all that is said about it. Now, %name% just needs to lay low. | Tortured by a rival gang, she came to miss a number of teeth, fingernails, and any drive to return to thieving. | Her time as a thief came to an end when, arrested, she spent five days pilloried during tomato season. | Naturally, it wasn\'t long until she went to prison. She doesn\'t speak of her time there, but it is obvious she wishes to never return. | But one day she learned there are much better ways to spin a blade for a coin than petty thievery. | But her half-brother was captured by a local gang, forcing the thief to find new ways to pay the hefty ransom. | But life as a brigand is not easy. Arrested for eating a chicken that was not hers, the man forfeited two fingers and any will to keep thieving. | After a heist went south, the woman fingered all her former partners to save her own hide. Now she can never go back to thieving.} {For all you know %name% is just using sellswords to hide behind. Regardless of her reasons, she\'s still going to have to earn her pay. | You recognize %name% from some posters.  Well, a woman who has gotten this far without being caught must have some value. | With one hand, %name% twirls a blade between her fingers. With the other, she snags your purse. Impressive. Now give it back. | Years of thieving have made %name% adept at escaping trouble. | %name% has the skills to be a good mercenary, just be sure to watch your purse while around her. | You can\'t trust a woman like %name%, but that attribute has plenty of company anyway. | Supposedly, somebody once shot an arrow at %name%. They missed, but the thief kept the feathers. | %name%\'s effort to join sellswords better not be a scheme to steal from your coffers. | Wanted posters say %name% is considered \'armed and dangerous\'. Perfect. | There are plenty of lawmen looking for %name%. Maybe you can get them to join, too.}";
