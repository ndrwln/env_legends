The voice spoke a language you\'d never heard before, and yet you understood it nonetheless. Two faces emerged for the infinite shade: %sac1% and %sac2%. The men seemed so close, yet when you reached out they shrank, as though your fingers stretched infinitely into the void.\n\n Upon waking, you knew what must be done. But a trust had been put in you here, a trust by Davkul. A trust to do what few men can: make a choice. | Davkul\'s presence arrived during a campfire. The rest of the men faded into the aether of infinite black, and a strange entity replaced them. An entity which you could not see, but whose presence was but a penumbra of crossing shadows. It requested a sacrifice, not by speaking to you, but by showing: %sac1% and %sac2%. First one melted away before revivifying, then the other repeated the process until both existed with their hands out and eyes closed. It was clear that Davkul was trusting you with a choice. \n\n When the shadows snapped away, the campfire was blinding. %sac1% and %sac2% were staring at you.%SPEECH_ON%Is all alright, sir?%SPEECH_OFF% | You traveled to the place. You knew you were sleeping, but you knew damn well you traveled there nonetheless, shifting beyond your mind, beyond your body, coursing over the earth, over its rivers, across its dry earth, and past the mountains which would crumble. There you found Davkul, the immutable darkness, the inviting shade.\n\n %sac1% and %sac2% were already there, standing closest to you and Davkul\'s shape shifted restlessly behind their images. A black hand of fog pushed one man forward and then yanked him back, then repeated it with the other man. You nodded in understanding. A sacrifice was required and you were to choose.}",

You see a face twisting in the smoke of the sacrifice, a knowing visage that approves. The company are emboldened. | %sacrifice% is chopped to pieces until they are but a torso and head. The blood has emptied across the ground and yet there\'s still light in the eyes and a perverse smile upon the face. You take an axehead and run it into the throat until %sacrifice% is no more. Every bodypart is separated and put upon a pole, caked in grease, and lit aflame. You and the faithful dance beneath the pyres as the night comes and the night goes. | The procession is such: %sacrifice% is flayed alive and pierced with sharpened sticks through each limb and held aloft, spread-eagled over a fire which cooks the sacrifice until death. The faithful watch %sacrifice%\'s passing in silence, but as soon as one of the charred limbs breaks and collapses  the corpse into the flames the faithful cheer and hoot and holler, some pray, others roll around in the ashes of %sacrifice%, some licking it off their fingertips like it were sweets. It is a good night. | A long stick is pierced through %sacrifice% from posterior to out the side of the neck. The sacrifice is tilted up into the sky and held there by one person while others use long spears to stab %sacrifice% through until the corpse is the apex of an uncovered tent. The conical corpse is then covered with grass and mud until there stands a tipi, a torso and head of %sacrifice% all that remains above, and should you enter the tent you would find legs dangling from its ceiling.
