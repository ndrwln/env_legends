You are happy to have passed.\n\n%sacrifice% unbuttons their shirt and %cultist% pierces the chest as though he were putting a key into a lock, and twists it all the same.

But %sacrifice% smiles, and the light doesn\'t so much go out of the eyes as the darkness, a sort you haven\'t seen before, replaces it. And like that, %sacrifice% is gone.\n\n %cultist% gets to work on the still warm corpse, carving the flesh with rapid slices across the skin and hard cuts into the tendons. Pulling the chest apart, a black fog lingers with the blade\'s every move, and it seems to sway cheerily after its every move.
