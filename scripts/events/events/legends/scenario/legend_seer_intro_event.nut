The wheel has turned, the cycles are in motion, there will be a lot more trouble in the world before the stars bode well again. In the meantime you might need to keep moving, you might not have a whole village bringing you sweet meat, but you made it out with enough coppers to at least find some apprentices to chop the wood and make tea",
