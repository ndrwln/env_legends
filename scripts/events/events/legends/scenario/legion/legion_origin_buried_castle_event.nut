The %companyname% takes %joiner% back into the service. | %joiner% calls down from the battlements of a half buried castle, hailing you in the name of the emperor. %companyname% soon welcomes %joiner% back to the legion. | With a nod of a skinless head %joiner% claims to be at the speartip of the emperor\'s purpose. You nod and welcome %joiner% into the %companyname%.  | %joiner% falls in with the company and there is little argument as to why.
