No one says a word and you simply direct %joiner% to the inventory where the purpose may gather teeth. | With a nod of a skinless head %joiner% claims to be at the speartip of the Emperor\'s purpose. You nod and welcome %joiner% into the %companyname%. | Marching in the name of the emperor, you were bound to find willing soldiers such as %joiner%. Keen on joining the company, in particular because you are in command of it, and more particularly due to a belief the Emperor has chosen you. | %joiner% bands with the company and there is little argument as to why. When asked where %joiner% came from, there is a shrug and talk of the old empire while nodding knowingly in your direction.}",
