As you approach %joiner% hails the Emperor, and is welcomed into the %companyname%. | %joiner% scouted out your party for a time before finding it safe to approach. All it took was the mention of the Emperor\'s name and the pact was made. %joiner% joins the company. | The Emperor surely watches over you as a soldier by the name of %joiner% joins the %companyname%. He states but one purpose, to find you and ensure that this world sees all that awaits it. | %joiner% rises from the dirt as you approach, chanting for the glory of the Emperor and his eternal gaze that surely watches over your party whole. The %companyname% takes %joiner% beneath its boney wing. | %joiner% finds the %companyname% on the march and joins its ranks as though no stranger at all. No one says a word and you simply direct %joiner% to the inventory where the purpose may gather teeth. | With a nod of a skinless head %joiner% claims to be at the speartip of the Emperor\'s purpose. You nod and welcome %joiner% into the %companyname%.  | %joiner% falls in with the company and there is little argument as to why. When asked where %joiner% came from, the answer is a gesture to the ground beneath you, and talk of an ancient battle for the empire.}",
