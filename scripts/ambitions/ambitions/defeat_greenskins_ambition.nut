Orcs and goblins had united in a savage green tide that threatened to wash away the race of man.\n\nUnder a pitiless sun at day and by the light of burning towns at night, the company campaigned against the green menace across the borderlands, rooting it out wherever it raised its ugly, scarred head. The men faced many a hard battle, and made many a sacrifice, but it was all worth it.\n\nThe %companyname% prevailed. After many a savage struggle, after uncounted days where each man\'s life seemed to hang on the roll of a die, the green tide finally seemed to ebb. As orcs and goblins scatter back into the wild, you know that the world of man is saved. For now.";
