Your men are getting too rowdy, and he\'s concerned they may take advantage of his family\'s hospitality, walking off with the silver plate or fighting with the staff. He notes that there has already been a broken window and points towards some broken glass on the floor.\n\nYou reply that although %winninghouse% was victorious, it is also at this point much weaker and more vulnerable than ever. Now would be a foolish time to alienate friends... or to make new enemies.\n\nHe takes your advice to heart and the celebration continues until dawn.";
