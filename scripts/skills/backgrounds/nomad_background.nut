Some event, which the nomad-turned-sellsword refuses to explain, ushered them into the cities looking for work. | A rule of %their% tribe is that every third son must travel out to see the world and, if they so wishe, return. So, here %name% stands. | Accused of sexual impropriety with a woman not formally gifted to them, %name% was faced with execution or exile from the tribe. Their breathing and standing before you hints at which of the two they chose. | Having murdered one of their fellow tribesman over a gambling debt, the nomad was exiled from %their% tribe. | But a disastrous ambush, which they were responsible for planning, saw %them% voted out of their particular tribe. | But the nomad wished to see more of the world, to see themself as more than what %they% could muster within the confines of their tribe, and so they left and ventured to the cities for adventurous work.} {The nomad stands before you every bit of their upbringing: darkly toned, eyes black, hands sanded down. If they\'s not a warrior already, they presumably could be trained into one with time. | As a man of the unbearable sands of the south, it\'s no surprise that the nomad is physically ready to take on the tasks of sellswording. Whether the skills are there is another matter entirely. | Men who venture the desert wastes are a hardy lot and %name% is no different. | Nomads such as %name% earn most of their combat experience ambushing caravans. It could be of use in a mercenary band, though frontline work is a fair bit different than waylaying poor merchants. | %name% is every bit of the South as you expect: worn down by the sands, yet standing with the constitution of a man ready to take on the day and all those to come. | %name% is unlikely to be a trained and skilled fighter quite yet, but as a man of the southern wastes there is little doubt that they has the heart and spirit of a warrior.}";
