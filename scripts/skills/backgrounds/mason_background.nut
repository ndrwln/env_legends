A church he built collapsed and out of its ruins rose a murderous mob looking for revenge. | Five buildings built, five buildings knocked down. Endless wars made the man\'s vocation an impossible one. | Betrayed by a fellow architect, the mason bricked his rival inside the walls of his next project. It wasn\'t long until people started asking questions. | While roofing, the man took a misstep and fell. The ensuing injuries forced him out of his field. | But when a lord demanded he build a horrific dungeon, the mason refused. Now he is banished from ever laying a brick again. | A misplaced blueprint had the mason building the temple of the Davkulians and not the temple of the Davkuliads. Now he says the gods themselves are after him.} {Putting down his hammer and chisel for a hammer and sharpened chisel called a sword, %name% now works in the field of mercenaries. | One day, a poster for a mercenary troop caught his eye. Much like his old buildings, the rest is history. | Years of masonry made the man fit for a life of blood and mud. | %name% finds a flaw in every building he passes.
