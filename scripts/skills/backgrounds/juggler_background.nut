They conspired against him - and his poor wrists. | When an assassin killed the lord he was entertaining, the juggler was the first to be accused. He barely escaped with his life.} {Now, %name% seeks a new path, even if death itself has become his audience. | Now, %name% finds respite in the company of equally down-on-their-luck men. | With fast hands and quick reactions, %name% should have no problem hitting his targets. | Juggling knives with his eyes closed, %name% knows exactly where to throw each blade. | There is far more coin in killing than juggling, a sad reality %name% has come to accept.}";
