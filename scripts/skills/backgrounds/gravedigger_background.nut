To the gravedigger, {death is now but a science | the dead have been better company than the living | earning gold for burying the dead is no new task}. {Employed by a wagon-train, %name% traveled the land and dug it up, too. But one day his burial was suddenly undone. Not by the buzzards or rats, but by the dead itself. Seeing such a sight, and having to bury the same man twice, no doubt compels a swift career change. | Every gravedigger is eyed with suspicion. It wasn\'t long until his patrons became accusers and the notion of a horrific crime of undead passion drove him from his work. The claims are absurd, but you can\'t get a read on his pale face. It\'s like playing cards with the moon. | By now, the man looks as if he could use a change of scenery. Just don\'t ask him to bury the casualties.}";
