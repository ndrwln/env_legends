The gods would approve.} {When war came to the land, the gods told them to take part for greater justice. | As cultists spread their vile word like disease on a rat, %name% saw fit to take up arms and battle the heresy. | Straying from their faith, they committed a horrific crime in %randomtown% - finding company with a man. While flagellating himself nightly, he seeks redemption. | Hearing but a mere rumor of a holy place, the pilgrim took up staff and supplies to seek it out. | Now that war has returned to the land, the gods devotee wished to find out why, through prayer and corporeal means. | A night spent in a cave revealed to the believer that the gods demanded blood. %name% was not one to refuse their beckoning. | After raiders looted the coffers of their church, %name%\'s quest was to refill the pure purses.} {As the laws of the universe bend to a world-consuming war, a thaumaturge like %name% might be useful to have around. | They carry a whip with glass-barbed leather. This is not for your enemies, they state, but for purity. Interesting. | They profess to hate evil, but for a few crowns %name% can be persuaded to make anything \'evil\'. | This chosen one seeks the difficult road, no doubt why they saw fit to join a mercenary band. | If %name% had the power, you believe they\'d purge the entire world. | Talks of the gods might be a tad irksome, but %name%\'s fiery passion lends itself well to the battlefield. | So enamored with the world of the gods, it\'s not much of a surprise that the pilgrim sees the real one filled with enemies.}";
