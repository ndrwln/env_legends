The life of a conscript has not appealed to them since. | %name% always carries a set of \'lucky\' dice around — which have not been working correctly so far, based on how many questions they asked you about their pay. | After a greenskin ambush, %name% managed to survive by hiding in the barrel of a mortar, gently cooking themselves in the desert heat until they were found and warned for their cowardice.} {Mounting debts has caused them to seek a new path — either to escape their debtors or to earn enough coin to buy their way out of trouble. | While better trained and drilled than other militia, %name% does have some rough edges that could be rounded off — assuming you can get them away from the bottle. | A life of steel, gunpowder and searing heat is enough for anyone to want a change, and %name% intends to do just that. | %name% thought about running with some nomads for a while, but given the strength of the Vizier\'s army in which they saw first hand has made them reconsider and seek more legitimate employment. | While not as experienced as a professional soldier, %name% can stand alone and tall against almost any threat.}";
