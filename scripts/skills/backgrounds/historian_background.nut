He seeks redemption in the world of what he studied: war. | Using his position in academia to bed women, eventual scandals and controversies drove the historian from his field, and left him penniless and ready to take on any job. | Bored with reading about adventurers, the historian figured he\'d suit up to fashion himself a closer look at the real thing. | With so many mercenary bands floating around, the historian sought to attach himself for some real-life studying.} {%name% has little in common with actual soldiers, but his imaginative mind fancies a good battle nonetheless. | While %name% spent all his life writing, he spent exactly none of it fighting.
