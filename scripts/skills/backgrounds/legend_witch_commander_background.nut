An amazing display that leaves the woman too tired to attempt it again. | Predictions of the weather are common, but %name% is unusually accurate with her own. | %name% asks to read your palms. You decline. Her presence alone is as close as you\'re willing to go. | %name% suggests that the stars are a roadmap to another world. She seems to know a lot about the heavens above. | %name% suggests that the heavens above are in fact just endless streams of beings, continuing on for eons.
