The nun eventually left to seek spirituality on her own terms. | As the world\'s suffering grew, %name%\'s abbess requested that she go out and heal the people of the earth. | Cults of death, beasts of nightmare, and men of cruelty. %name% left the halls of her temple to purify them all. | But when a child asked her a faith-shattering question, %name% abandoned her faith, seeking out spirituality by other means. | Unfortunately, prayer did not spare her sisters from a slaughter. %name% realized that her faith was better invested in looking out for herself than muttering to some so-called god. | Always a fiery woman, %name% left the safety of the monasteries to go out and \'right\' the world. | One of the few literate women around, %name% abandoned her ascetic life to learn more of the world and, hopefully, to cure that which sickened it. | But one night a man bedded her. She woke with her faith cratered in the crumpled sheets around her. Ashamed, she never returned to her monastery. | But she used her trusted position for ill-gotten gains, stealing from the temple\'s treasury. It didn\'t take long for the scandal to drive her out. | Unfortunately, a child accused her of behavior unbecoming of a nun. Nobody knows the truth behind the story, but %name% did not last much longer at the church. | One night, she discovered an awful truth in an old tome. Not long after, %name% quickly left the church, never quite saying what it was that she discovered.} {The woman hardly knows a thing about fighting, but she carries the mental fortitude of a mountain standing against a storm. | Years of solitude and prayer have left %name% out of shape, but it is her steeled mind that is of most value. | Perhaps never really content with her life, it\'s difficult to entirely know why someone like %name% would join a band of mercenaries. | Maybe there are too many devils in the world, or too many inside her, but you don\'t question why %name% wishes to join a band of sellswords. | Faith won\'t cleave a greenskin, but it won\'t have a woman like %name% running away from one, either. | %name%\'s stated desire to rid the world of \'the unfaithful\' is almost scary in its determination. | While %name%\'s spirituality is to be commended, the constant mutterings to the old gods are a bit annoying. | While %name%\'s hands are better clasped in prayer than around the handle of a sword, few mercenaries have the sense of resolve that she does. | A holy book practically anchored to her wrist, %name% has sought the company of sellswords. | The holy book she carries is thick enough to be used as a shield, but %name% looks absolutely horrified when you say as much out loud. | Perhaps with a romantic view of mercenaries in need of a good spiritual cleansing, %name% seeks to accompany sellswords. | Once having read of warrior priestesses, %name% now wishes to emulate those brave, unwavering soldiers of faith. | You get the feeling %name% wants release from this sinful world. If that\'s the truth then she has come to the right place.}";
