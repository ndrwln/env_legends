	"Damn nigh impossible to find a reliable shield \'round here, bloody things keep breaking in two. Been keeping a spare on me back now just incase. I should charge more for fighting men with axes, ha!",
	"One day I\'ll be standard bearer of the company. It\'s only the bravest of us all and they\'ve been with the company for years and years, y\'know, but it\'s the greatest honor for a man with common blood. I\'ve seen even a knight once shake the hand of ours.",
	"I\'ve trained militia before, and let me tell you, spears are the best weapons for when the soldiers don\'t know what they\'re doing yet. Cheap and easy to hit with. Put a few folk together for a spearwall and it\'s hard to even get close to them without a spear in your belly.",
